## Reflection of industry visit to UTM DIGITAL👨‍💻

The visit to UTM DIGITAL proved to be an enlightening experience, providing valuable insights into the intricacies of the industry. Exploring various areas such as the director's office, strategy room, and innovation room allowed us to grasp the diverse responsibilities associated with each position and gain familiarity with their dynamic working environment. A highlight of the visit was the exploration of the data center, where we gained a fundamental understanding of data storage. This aspect is particularly beneficial for students, especially those studying data engineering, as it reinforces their knowledge about data management. The visit not only broadened our understanding of the data field but also offered a clear perspective on the nature of the job of a data engineer. This newfound knowledge serves as a guiding light, providing students like myself with a clearer direction for future career pursuits in the dynamic world of data.
